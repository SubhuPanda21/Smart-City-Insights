# Smart-City-Insights
An AI-powered Smart City Sustainability platform that analyzes urban data, predicts environmental trends, and provides interactive tools like dashboards, AI predictions, and what-if simulations to support smarter, greener city decisions.

# 🌆 AI Smart City Insights Platform

The AI Smart City Insights Platform is an intelligent system designed to support sustainable urban development using Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.  
It helps analyze city-related data, predict environmental trends, and simulate decisions that can impact urban sustainability.

This project combines machine learning, visualization, and interactive tools to make complex urban data easier to understand and use.


# 🌍 Why This Project?

Modern cities face challenges like pollution, traffic congestion, energy consumption, and climate impact. Making the right decisions requires understanding large amounts of data.

This platform was built to:
- Help visualize urban data clearly
- Predict future environmental conditions
- Allow “what-if” simulations for planning
- Support smarter and greener decision-making


# 🚀 Main Features

# 📊 Data Dashboard  
Interactive dashboards to visualize urban metrics and sustainability indicators.

# 🤖 AI Prediction Module  
Machine learning models predict trends related to environmental and city parameters.

# 🔮 What-If Simulator  
Users can change inputs (like green cover or pollution levels) and see how it affects the city’s future.

# 📷 Live Vision (Computer Vision)  
Analyzes live or captured images to simulate traffic or environment-based detections.

# 🧠 Explainable AI  
Shows feature importance to help understand how the AI model makes predictions.

# 💬 AI Chat Assistant  
A conversational assistant to answer sustainability and city-related questions.
